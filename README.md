# 2250-project
SE2250 Final Project - Group 34

##Features implemented so far:
- Explorable dungeon
- Character customization (stats affecting speed, jump, attack, health, perception)
- Character progression (XP and level-up system)
- Character movement (walking and jumping)
- Enemies that can move and attack
- Combat (ranged and melee)
- Solvable puzzle with XP reward

##TODO:
- Make another level (just the terrain, most other stuff can be reused)
- Make the pressure plate in the hall trigger the swinging trap
- Make it possible to clear the caved-in hall
- Add something (probably XP) to the room after the cave-in
- Add an exit after the boss room
- Something with an animation (maybe use animation instead of a script to make the collectibles spin?)
